[N/A] igure out how to authenticate in my App
[N/A] figure out how to make requests with reddit API
[ ] figure out how to render the response
[ ] figure out how to pull down to refresh
[ ] figure out local storage

[ ] figure out how to deploy to android
[ ] write up readme with instructions


[ ] Use Redux
[X] Create a main screen that fetches from Redditâ€™s API (https://www.reddit.com/.json) and displays the basic content
    (author, title, thumbnail, up votes, etc) in a list
[ ] Users should be able to pull to refresh the list
[ ] Clicking on a specific item should transition to a different screen within the app. This screen's content can
    simply display the same basic content. Users should be able to go back to the main screen (React Navigation is
    a good option for this)
[ ] Create a public Github repo for this project with instructions on how to get the app running and send me the link
    after you're done


Store the fetched content locally so that if you relaunch the app, it will display that content first before fetching for new content. I recommend using Redux Persist or AsyncStorage
Works for both iOS and Android
Share some words about your thought process, design/architectural decisions, challenges you faced, etc

Please have the project back to us by the end of the week (Friday, 7/21). Feel free to reach out if you have any questions at all.
